# Actions

Actions define what any agent can do in the environment.

## `FlapAction`

The agent can only choose whether to match under a maximum cardinality
matching or not.

## `BloodAction`

The agent chooses a re-weight vector which adjusts the weights
between edges of different blood type pairings.
